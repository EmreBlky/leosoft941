    This guide helps you completely remove screen time or set it up without a password. <br>
     It should work on iOS 12-14 tested by me on iOS 14.

    <p> 
        1. Add this repo to your package manager of choice:  repo.syns.me <br><br>
        2. Download iSupervisor and verify that your device is in supervised mode by going to settings. 
        There should be some text at the top saying your device is in supervised mode.
    <br><br>
        3. Download configuration profile. If settings crashes when you install it, just try again.
        Wait a couple of seconds and make sure it says “screen time is restricted” or something along those lines when you go into your screen time settings. If this happens, you can remove the profile (if it hasn’t autoremoved after 20 seconds) and iSupervisor. If nothing happens after 20 seconds uninstall the profile if it hasn’t removed itself and try again.
        if everything works fine, remove the profile from settings and iSupervisor from your package manager. You can re-enable screen time with or without a password if you want.
        Hope this helps everyone who “accidentally turned on screen time and forgot the password” and people with overprotective parents. Use this wisely.
